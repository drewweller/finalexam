Introducing Billybob: <br/>

 In osTicket I have created a new user named billybob who will be working the tickets.
<br />
<br />

Random user creates ticket:  <br/>

In this step I went to the osTicket homepage as a guest user and created two tickets to use for this example.

This is what Billybob, or the user who will be working on tickets see when they sign in. You can also see the tickets ranked and shown by importance level. This was due to the sla I have setup.

Closing a ticket:  <br/>

In this picture you can see that Billybob has fixed an issue, so he is closing out the ticket and informing the person who created a ticket that the issue has been resolved.

<br />
Post ticket resolve:  <br/>

Now that the ticket was reolved Billybob no longer has them on his screen, so he will wait for his next ticket to resolve!
